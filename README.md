Delayed start. Quite busy with my studies rn. I wonder when the amout of time needed to solve the puzzles will get out of hand and I have to admit defeat.
25% done. Yesterday I stood already a little bit on the hose as we say here in Germany.

It's day 15 and it seems like I already scraped the limits of my possibilities. I wanted to be smart and used imaginary numbers and a set instead of a list of lists. The Example worked perfectly. But what I didn't know was with which audacity @topaz would generate the puzzle input. These numbers were way to high for my approach. So I had to start from scratch and it's still very slow. Part two went way easier, but only because I found this wonderful Solver(), which does all the work for me.
